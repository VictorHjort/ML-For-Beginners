# Assignment 2 - Regression, Logical Regression, and ANNs

##### 2.1 Linear Regression with Scikit-learn on [Linnerud dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_linnerud.html)

Take a look at the [Linnerud dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_linnerud.html#sklearn.datasets.load_linnerud) in Scikit-learn. This dataset has multiple [targets](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/toy_dataset.html#linnerrud-dataset): 'It consists of three exercise (data) and three physiological (target) variables collected from twenty middle-aged men in a fitness club'. In your own words, describe how to create a Regression model that would plot the relationship between the waistline and how many situps are accomplished. Then implement this model in a jupyter notebook.

What is the mean-squared error of your linear regression model? Does it improve when you use a polynomial regression?

##### 2.2 Logistic Regression

In [the lesson](https://github.com/SMC-AAU-CPH/ML-For-Beginners/tree/main/2-Regression/4-Logistic), you used a subset of the pumpkin data. Now, go back to the original data and try to use all of it, cleaned and standardized, to build a Logistic Regression model in a Jupyter notebook. Evaluate your model by a [confusion matrix](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html#confusion-matrix): remember to [calculate and visualize the ROC curve](https://github.com/SMC-AAU-CPH/ML-For-Beginners/tree/main/2-Regression/4-Logistic#visualize-the-roc-curve-of-this-model). Aim for a well-explained and well-performing model in your notebook.

##### 2.3 Digit Classification with Artificial Neural Networks

Using Scikit-learn on a jupyter notebook, can you train a Multilayer Perceptron on MNIST dataset for 10-digit classification? What are the performance metrics of your model? How could you improve the model performance?
